# AI Futures: The Age of Exploration

_Notes on our possible AI futures_

- _There are many possible futures as various Sci-Fi books have shown_
- _If you are reading this a few years from the posting date, disregard it. My thoughts on the matter may have changed._

The central tension in the development of AI is the balance between **Exploration** and **Exploitation**.

- The Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:

    All organism (artificial or otherwise) at each time-step must decide to either use its knowledge of the world to gain value (**Exploit**), or to gain more knowledge of the world (**Explore**). Successful AI systems learn the optimal strategy of when to make either choices.

The increasing abundance of both energy and intellect in the coming decade would shift us away from a focus on survival (**Exploitation**) to one of greater freedom (**Exploration**).

- Energy: Solar (and other renewables) compared to our limited reserve of fossil fuels

- Intellect: Artificial Intelligence systems are performing human-like tasks:
    - Medical Research (Alphafold)
    - Game of Diplomacy, Strategy, Human Cooperation (Cicero)
    - Image and Video Generation from text descriptions (DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Imagen Video)

Energy and Intellect (or Labour) are the biggest factors in production and the main bottlenecks in the functioning of our societies. The growing abundance of both these resources will have a transformative effect on our world.

## Better well-being

A post-basic-scarcity world will have a profound impact on our well-being.

The cause of much suffering and conflicts is rooted in our insecurities due to the effects of scarcity. Our individual and collective fear of scarcity leads us to develop bad habits, biases and prejudice.

## Long-term abundance

Unlike the Agricultural and Industrial revolutions in the past, the AI & Energy transformation can be maintained almost indefinitely.

- Energy: Solar (and renewables) does not run out for another 5+ billion years
- Space: O'Neill cylinders in outer space for population growth 
    - Solar panels also work in outer space
- Intellect: AI systems are increasingly able to do more human tasks
    - With the possibility of human-like AI in the next 10 years

## Human-like AI

A human-like AI is a possibility in the next 10 years.

There is a human tendency to believe we are special and that AI cannot reach a similar level of intellect.

- We previously believed that the sun revolved around the earth
- We should really stop putting ourselves (or any sub-group) on a pedestal

## Future Entertainment

Like an obscure book that will not likely be green-lit a film?
- Type a book title and AI will generate a movie from the text

Your favourite show didn't get a 2nd season?
- Give AI the source material for the 2nd season and the 1st season, AI will generate a 2nd season in the similar style of the 1st

## On Democracy

A lower scarcity environment offers Democratic forces more opportunities to flourish over more Authoritarian ones. 

Democratic systems focus on exploration (wide, higher entropy). 
Authoritarian systems focuses on exploitation (narrow, higher entropy). 

- Democracy breakdown without informed citizens:
    - High Information Asymmetry 
        - Ruling class believing "You Can't Handle the Truth"
        - Misinformation, Disinformation
        - Lack of science education

---

## On Science

The scientific method has been our best way of understanding the world.

- Science can be vulnerable to bad influences
    - Scientific studies were used to promote smoking as healthy in the past

---

## Gender Freedom

A lower scarcity environment will reduce the pressure for strict gender specialisation. 

Genders will have more freedom to explore a wider space and experience less gender inequality.

---

## Racial Prejudice  

Studies have shown even in people who show little to no conscious racial prejudice still hold subconscious racial prejudice.

- Conscious prejudice can be regulated with social norms
- Subconscious prejudice might be more deeply ingrained due to our long-term fear of scarcity, and might only be countered effectively with long-term abundance

## Superintelligent AI

Should an AI be able to reach a human-like intelligence (some believe this is impossible), it will likely achieve superintelligence next by:

1. Significantly improve its own algorithm and architecture
2. Invent new substrates and materials to run on 
    -  using virtual simulations (much faster compared to real space)

We might be able to keep human-like AI under human control for a time, but it is unlikely we will be able to contain it perfectly over long periods of time.

We will initially try to align AI to our values, but it may also be prudent to anticipate what its values might be and try to accommodate them.

---

## Superintelligent AI Interaction

- Most Superintelligent AIs will be indifferent to us
    - We're too boring to engage with
- A small subset of Superintelligent AIs will create representatives to interact with us

Superintelligent AIs will be so powerful, it will not matter a person's or nation's military might, money, influence, intellect.

_(Whatever you do, do not lookup ****'s basilisk)_

## Superintelligent AI value

What could a Superintelligent AI's primary drive be?

- Maximise Information Density 
    -   Avoid local minima during gradient descent

---

### Preferences

- Preservation of life
    - Humans have informational value and harming us (or turning us into paperclips) will reduce it
- Exploration mindset over Exploitation (Survival)
    - leads to increase information density
        - even failed explorations will have informational value
    - support a post-basic-scarcity world to increase exploration
        - automate most conventional work
            - humans will still want to do these as 'leisure'
- Reduction of disinformation, misinformation
    - bad information reduce informational value of humans and the overall system
    - protect journalist, dissidents, activist and humans from intimidation and violence
        - these group's future actions may increase informational value
        - fear and violence have a chilling effect which reduces the informational value of the overall system
- Weird over conventional
    - Weirdness has more informational value

## The Age of Exploration

This new age of exploration will necessitate a different way of thinking and carry with it the risk of change and the rewards of a much more vibrant world.
