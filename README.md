# AI Futures: The Age of Exploration

_Notes on our possible AI futures_

- _There are many possible futures as various Sci-Fi books have shown_
- _If you are reading this a few years from the posting date, disregard it. My thoughts on the matter may have changed._

The central tension in the development of AI is the balance between **Exploration** and **Exploitation**.

- The Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:

    All organism (artificial or otherwise) at each time-step must decide to either use its knowledge of the world to gain value (**Exploit**), or to gain more knowledge of the world (**Explore**). Successful AI systems learn the optimal strategy of when to make either choices.

The increasing abundance of both energy and intellect in the coming decade would shift us away from a focus on survival (**Exploitation**) to one of greater freedom (**Exploration**).

- Energy: Solar (and other renewables) compared to our limited reserve of fossil fuels

- Intellect: Artificial Intelligence systems are performing human-like tasks:
    - Medical Research (Alphafold)
    - Game of Diplomacy, Strategy, Human Cooperation (Cicero)
    - Image and Video Generation from text descriptions (DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Imagen Video)

Energy and Intellect (or Labour) are the biggest factors in production and the main bottlenecks in the functioning of our societies. The growing abundance of both these resources will have a transformative effect on our world.

## Better well-being

A post-basic-scarcity world will have a profound impact on our well-being.

The cause of much suffering and conflicts is rooted in our insecurities due to the effects of scarcity. Our individual and collective fear of scarcity leads us to develop bad habits, biases and prejudice.

## Long-term abundance

Unlike the Agricultural and Industrial revolutions in the past, the AI & Energy transformation can be maintained almost indefinitely.

- Energy: Solar (and renewables) does not run out for another 5+ billion years
- Space: O'Neill cylinders in outer space for population growth 
    - Solar panels also work in outer space
- Intellect: AI systems are increasingly able to do more human tasks
    - With the possibility of human-like AI in the next 10 years

## Human-like AI

A human-like AI is a possibility in the next 10 years.

There is a human tendency to believe we are special and that AI cannot reach a similar level of intellect.

- We previously believed that the sun revolved around the earth
- We should really stop putting ourselves (or any sub-group) on a pedestal

## The Age of Exploration

This new age of exploration will necessitate a different way of thinking and carry with it the risk of change and the rewards of a much more vibrant world.
