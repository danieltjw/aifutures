# AI Futures: The Age of Exploration

_Notes on our possible AI futures_

The central tension in the development of AI is the balance between **Exploration** and **Exploitation**.

- The Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off:

    All organism (artificial or otherwise) at each time-step must decide to either use its knowledge of the world to gain value (**Exploit**) or to gain more knowledge of the world (**Explore**). Successful AI systems learn the optimal strategy of when to make either choices.

The increasing availability of both energy and intellect in the coming decade would shift us away from a focus on **Exploitation** to one of **Exploration**.

- Energy: Solar (and other renewables) compared to our limited reserve of fossil fuels

- Intellect: Artificial Intelligence systems are performing human-like tasks:
    - Medical Research (Alphafold)
    - Game of Diplomacy, Strategy, Human Cooperation (Cicero)
    - Image and Video Generation from text descriptions (DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Imagen Video)

Energy and Intellect (or Labour) are the biggest factors in production and the main bottlenecks in the functioning of our societies. The increasing availability of both these resources will have a transformative effect on our world.

This new age of exploration will necessitate a different way of thinking and carry with it the risk of change and the rewards of a much more vibrant world.
